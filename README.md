# E-commerce-Product-Page
[Click Here](https://charo-jp.github.io/E-commerce-Product-Page/) to go to my E-commerce-product-page.

## What I created
I created a single page for a sneaker shop which displays an item (a pair of shoes).

## Features of this website
- Pop up screen that appears when clicking a cart button in a header disappears when clicking other parts of website.

- Pop up screen that lets you know item(s) has added to your cart. Its message changes when trying to add zero items to "Please add more than 1 item".

- Same as navigation bar (only when the width is smaller than 768px)

- Slide show 

- Responsive design

## Challenges
- I struggled how to create a slide and add an animation to it. I am glad that now I can use this code to implement other applications.

- I also had a hard time to come up with an idea that popup screen disappears when clicking other elements.
I managed to solve this problem by detecting all click events on Window but pop-up screen and cart-button.

- It was extremely difficult for me to organize sass files. They are still messy. So in next project, I would like to make a plan before actually writing a code.

## What I learned
What I learned through this project is basically all the things mentioned above. 
- I learned how to create slideshow.

- I learned how to handle event caused by clicking.

- I learned how to organize sass files.

- I learned how to handle responsive design 
(I totally misunderstood what the mobile design is. You probably see my improvement in my Calculator Application in which you can see 
[Here](https://github.com/charo-jp/Calculator))

## What I used for this project.
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript
